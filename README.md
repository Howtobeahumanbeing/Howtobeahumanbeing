 <p align="center"> ive been very burnt out lately so i might not respond very well or at all 

 <p align="center">     
 i will interact with anyone but i usually wont do it as much with people younger than 15 that arent already friends with me

 <p align="center">    i not so often say slurs i CAN reclaim, like the n-word being an afrolatino person, say flirty and sexual jokes if youre around my age and i see youre comfortable with it
